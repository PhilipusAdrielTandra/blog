<h1>Statistics Project Proposal - Breast Cancer</h1>
<br>
<hr>

<p> <b>Problem Statement</b> <br>
    Cancer is a disease that has plagued the world and we are trying to rid of the one that
    is the most important being breast cancer. This has led to us to using this dataset
    being a breast cancer dataset that gets measurements of the chest and classifies them into
    having malginant and benign tumors. <br>

    We look to use machine learning, particularly OpenCV to try and use images as the input for our
    dataset and predicitons. This can work as an application for those who are looking to find whether they
    have cancer or not and are too shy as breasts can be a sensitive topic where a computer can be used
    to help reduce any human involvement.

<h1>Grocery Shopping System Project Proposal - Database</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>28th October 2022 Group Members: Philipus Adriel Tandra, Daniel Eric Phangandy</h3>
<hr>
<p> We want to create a Grocery Shop program that
    works like a point of sale system with items that have their
    own respective item code and number for a barcode as well as their
    stock numbers. We also wanted to be unique by using Python
    to connect to our existing SQL database by using SQL connector
    and the other frameworks that work with Python such as Django
    and tkinter. This is because grocery stores have a huge amount
    of items and as a result, it can be hard to look through and even tell
    whether the business is doing well or not. This is why we are looking to
    use visualizations in the form of Python. Luckily, Django has ways to make
    and form graphs based on databases. We also have the potential to use different
    Python libraries such as Pandas to import said databases into a CSV file 
    for further inspection.
</p>

<p>
    By doing this, we are able to make a GUI that can go along
    with our SQL Database as well as serve as a way for us
    to manipulate database from a different way rather than 
    just opening the SQL Files themselves from the server. We will create
    two tables in the database, one for the actual grocery items themselves with 
    stock, itemID, etc. Based on existing stores such as Grand Lucky, we also want to include
    a membership table that includes a list of names and phone numbers.
