<p>For our topic, we wanted to create something that 
    felt tangible and also had a its own way of being unique.
    With that, we wanted to create a Grocery Shop program that
    works like a point of sale system with items that have their
    own respective item code and number for a barcode as well as their
    stock numbers. We alsow watned to be unique by using Python
    to connect to our existing SQL database by using SQL connector
    and the other frameworks that work with Python such as Django
</p>

<p>
    By doing this, we are able to make a GUI that can go along
    with our SQL Database as well as serve as a way for us
    to manipulate database from a different way rather than 
    just opening the SQL Files themselves from the server.
</p>    
<pre>Please let us know what you think and what we should improve upon. Thank you</pre>
