<p> I worked on a few of the machine learning algorithms, particulary for MLPClassifier and KMeans. I also helped with the feature importance such as Pearson Correlation and helped for the graphing
    and documentation of the project. I also helped get the Feature Univariate Score and helped the rest of my team with help for T-test, ANOVA and Confidence interval. I also helped with the new dataset 
    and included it in our research paper and was mostly in charge of the communications work with the lecturers.<br><br> With that said, I could not have done without my team and they deserve the most credit. We were like gears, we worked together in tandem with each other and highly commend Peter and Vincent for their hard work especially in the emotional
    department. They are my colleagues and my greatest of friends and helped me throughout this semester especially for this final project.

    This project taught me a lot about the actual importance of statistics is when it comes to creating research papers and supporting our statements and hope to learn more.

<p> <b>Problem Statement</b> <br>
    Cancer is a disease that has plagued the world and we are trying to rid of the one that
    is the most important being breast cancer. This has led to us to using this dataset
    being a breast cancer dataset that gets measurements of the breast cancer nuclei and classifies them into
    having malginant and benign tumors. We also seek to look at the different risk factors to see if they can influence
    the presence of cancer<br>

    We look to use machine learning and compare them on our dataset and make predicitons. This way we can also find the feature
    importance of each dataset
