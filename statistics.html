<p> <b>Problem Statement</b> <br>
    Cancer is a disease that has plagued the world and we are trying to rid of the one that
    is the most important being breast cancer. This has led to us to using this dataset
    being a breast cancer dataset that gets measurements of the chest and classifies them into
    having malginant and benign tumors. <br>

    We look to use machine learning, particularly OpenCV to try and use images as the input for our
    dataset and predicitons. This can work as an application for those who are looking to find whether they
    have cancer or not and are too shy as breasts can be a sensitive topic where a computer can be used
    to help reduce any human involvement.
