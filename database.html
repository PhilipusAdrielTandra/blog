<h1>Creating the pages</h1>
<br>

<p> The great thing about Django is something known as template inheritence which is also just a way to transfer over code from one html file to the next.
    Thats why most fanous websites like Youtube and Instagram have an overlay that carries over to its different pages. For now, we will be using boostrap.

<p>It will have a main store page that takes from a table with the products and its data such as its name, price, etc. 
    Im thinking of creating an add to cart and checkout feature, it would be cool

<p> Since we decided on the framework and topic, I thought it would be a great idea to reference
    a real world superstore, GrandLucky and make my own twist on it with some inspirations coming from the real thing

<p> We have decided to use django for our program as it acts as the perfect full-stack framework
    that not only does well for database management but is also provides an adequate frontend
    in the form of html and css. With Django's scalability it seemed like the right choice 
    for the job

<p>Here I have already initialized the django project with our very own tables that we created
    in SQL but here we are using SQLite. I might convert to importing from our mySQL file but 
    for I just want to see how the program would work.

<h1>ERD and tables</h1>

<p> We decided on adding a few tables being perishables, non perishables, membership for discount
    and lastly a form of transactions made. This table essentially acts as what a receipt would
    print out once the transaction is complete. Big thanks to Sir Daniel for advice on the tables.

<h1>Grocery Shopping System Project Proposal - Database</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>28th October 2022 Group Members: Philipus Adriel Tandra, Daniel Eric Phangandy</h3>
<hr>
<p> We want to create a Grocery Shop program that
    works like a point of sale system with items that have their
    own respective item code and number for a barcode as well as their
    stock numbers. We also wanted to be unique by using Python
    to connect to our existing SQL database by using SQL connector
    and the other frameworks that work with Python such as Django
    and tkinter. This is because grocery stores have a huge amount
    of items and as a result, it can be hard to look through and even tell
    whether the business is doing well or not. This is why we are looking to
    use visualizations in the form of Python. Luckily, Django has ways to make
    and form graphs based on databases. We also have the potential to use different
    Python libraries such as Pandas to import said databases into a CSV file 
    for further inspection.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img class="image1" src="assets/image.png">
</div>
<p>
    By doing this, we are able to make a GUI that can go along
    with our SQL Database as well as serve as a way for us
    to manipulate database from a different way rather than 
    just opening the SQL Files themselves from the server. We will create
    two tables in the database, one for the actual grocery items themselves with 
    stock, itemID, etc. Based on existing stores such as Grand Lucky, we also want to include
    a membership table that includes a list of names and phone numbers.
